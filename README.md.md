# 🌍🚀 Global Space Exploration Analysis in R
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of global space missions conducted by different countries across various years. It utilizes the tidyverse suite in R, focusing on data wrangling with dplyr and data visualization with ggplot2, through an R Markdown notebook.

## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information on space missions globally. It includes:

Country

Year

Mission Name

Mission Type (Manned or Unmanned)

Launch Site

Satellite Type

Budget (in Billion $)

Success Rate

Technology Used

Environmental Impact

Collaborating Countries

Duration (in Days)

## 🎯 Objectives
This project aims to:

Practice dplyr verbs like filter(), mutate(), summarize(), count(), group_by(), arrange(), and window functions like lag().

Explore visualizations using ggplot2 (histograms, box plots, bar charts, scatter plots, line plots).

Extract meaningful insights from a rich, real-world dataset.


## 📌 Key Questions Answered
Which country has launched the most space missions overall?

How has the global success rate of missions changed over the years?

What is the distribution of mission durations?

Which satellite types were most commonly used across all missions?

Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between budget and success rate.

Which missions had unusually long durations (outliers)?

Calculate the yearly change in success rate using window functions (lag()).

Which mission types (manned/unmanned) were launched more frequently?

What are the top missions by budget in a given country and year (e.g., China in 2025)?

Explore trends across continents, collaborations, or technologies used.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
R Language

RStudio

tidyverse (especially dplyr and ggplot2)

R Markdown for reporting and reproducibility

# ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the .Rmd file.

2. Open it in RStudio.

3. Ensure the required packages are installed:
```{r}
 install.packages("tidyverse")
 ```

4. Knit the R Markdown file to HTML or view inline.

5. Dataset is included as a CSV file in the project.
