## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary: Global Space Exploration Analysis in R

This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of a dataset on global space exploration activities using R programming. The dataset includes key information such as; 
  1:  Launching country, 
  2:  Mission year, 
  3:  Mission type, 
  4:  Launch site, 
  5:  Satellite type, 
  6:  Budget, 
  7:  Success rate, 
  8:  Technology used, 
  9:  Environmental impact, 
  10: Collaborating countries &,
  11: Mission duration. 

The primary goal was to derive meaningful insights from this data while practicing and demonstrating proficiency in data wrangling and data visualization using the tidyverse, particularly dplyr and ggplot2.


## Packages Including

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```

## Importing the CSV file

```{r}

# Data Analysis


## Country which has launched the most space missions overall.

```{r}
top_mission_countries <- Dataset %>%
  count(Country, name = "Total_Missions") %>%

print(top_mission_countries)   
```

## Global success rate of missions changed over the years.
```{r}

  theme_minimal()
  
```

## Top 5 countries that have spent the most on space missions.
```{r}
Top_Countries_spending <- Dataset %>%
group_by(Country) %>%
summarize(Total_Budget_in_Billion = sum(`Budget_(in Billion $)`)) %>%
slice_max(Total_Budget_in_Billion, n=5)

```

## Satellite types that were most commonly used across all missions.

```{r}
Common_Satellites_Type <- Dataset %>%
  group_by(Satellite_Type) %>%
  count(Satellite_Type, name = 'Number_of_Missions', sort = TRUE)

  labs(title = "Distribution of Mission Durations",
       x = "Duration (in Days)",
       y = "Number of Missions") +
